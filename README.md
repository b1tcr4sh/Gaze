My attempt at writing a Dbus CLI in Rust for [Lodestar](https://github.com/vividuwu/lodestar).
The [CSharp library on the backend](https://github.com/tmds/tmds.dbus) doesn't authenticate p2p connections and Zbus doesn't seem to like that.
This project will have to be on hiatus until that problem is solved, for now I'll just go ahead and write a CLI in C#.
